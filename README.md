# Python Classes Lab 

## Introduction
In this lab, you can practice object-oriented programming (OOP) by building a Tic-tac-toe terminal game with Python Classes.

While working through this lab, consider the gameplay of Tic-Tac-Toe and, if necessary, pseudocode it. Try to write several small functions, each performing a single purpose, e.g., `print_board`, `get_move`, `check_for_winner`, etc. Consider how/where looping makes sense, e.g., loop until the player enters a correct move or until the gameâ€™s over, etc.

## Setup
Open your Terminal application and navigate to your `~/code/ga/labs` directory:

```bash
cd ~/code/ga/labs
```

Make a new repository on GitHub named `python-classes-lab`.

Clone a copy of your remote repo locally by using the `git clone` command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/python-classes-lab.git
```

> ðŸ“š Note: In the link above, where it says `<your-username>`, you should see the username from your GitHub account.

Next, `cd` into your new cloned directory, `python-classes-lab`:

```bash
cd python-classes-lab
```

Create a file for the lesson:

```bash
touch exercises.py
```

Open the projectâ€™s folder in your code editor:

```bash
code .
```

## Exercises 
### User Stories
Your goal is to implement the following user stores:

- As a user (AAU), I want to see a welcome message at the start of a game.
- AAU, before being prompted for a move, I want to see the board printed in the console to know what moves have been made.
- AAU, at the beginning of each turn, told whose turn it is: Itâ€™s player Xâ€™s turn!
- AAU, I should be prompted to enter a move and be provided an example of valid input ('Enter a valid move (example: A1)').
- AAU, I want to be able to enter my moveâ€™s column letter in upper or lower case (a/A, b/B, or c/C) to make it easier to enter my move.
- AAU, if I enter a move in an invalid format or try to occupy a cell already taken, I want to see a message chastising me and be re-prompted.
- AAU, after entering a move, I should once again be presented with the updated game board, notified of the current turn, and asked to enter a move for the other player. This process should continue until there is a winner or a tie
- AAU, I should see a message at the end of the game indicating the winner or stating that the game ended in a tie.

### Hints
If you need some guidance with this lab, follow the steps below.

### Step 1 - Define a `Game` class and initialize game state
Create a `class` called `Game`. Within the `Game` class, use the `__init__` method to initialize properties that represent the state of your game.

Below are some of the attributes you might include:

- `turn`: a string attribute indicating whose turn it is (`'X'` or `'O'`). Initialize it with `'X'`.
- `tie`: a boolean attribute indicating if the game ended in a tie. Initialize it as `False`.
- `winner`: an attribute to store the game-winner. Initialize it as `None`.
- `board`: a dictionary representing the state of the game board:

    ```py
        {
        'a1': None, 'b1': None, 'c1': None,
        'a2': None, 'b2': None, 'c2': None,
        'a3': None, 'b3': None, 'c3': None,
        }
    ```
    Each key in the `board` represents a position on the board, with the corresponding value being an `'X'`, `'O'`, or an empty space (`None`).

    Modeling the board itself as a dictionary and naming the keys appropriately can simplify updating the board based on what the player types in. For example, assume you store the playerâ€™s input in a variable named `move`. You can convert it to lowercase using .lower() and use it as the key to access the `board`, i.e., `board[move]`.

### Step 2 - Playing the game
Next, define a `play_game` method and confirm that the method is accessible on an instance of the `Game` class. This function will be used to activate and organize the flow of the game.

- Within the `play_game` method, print a **welcome message** of your choosing.
- Instantiate the `Game` class and invoke the `play_game` method:

    ```py
    game_instance = Game()
    game_instance.play_game()
    ```
- Run the following command in your terminal to verify your welcome message:

    ```py
    python3 app.py
    ```

### Step 3 - Rendering
Next, youâ€™ll want to define methods that can â€˜renderâ€™ information for the user. Based on the separation of concerns, you might break this logic down into two or three methods.

Consider the following approach:

1. **Rendering the board**

    The `print_board` method visualizes the current state of the game `board`.

    ```py
    def print_board(self):
    b = self.board
    print(f"""
            A   B   C
        1)  {b['a1'] or ' '} | {b['b1'] or ' '} | {b['c1'] or ' '}
            ----------
        2)  {b['a2'] or ' '} | {b['b2'] or ' '} | {b['c2'] or ' '}
            ----------
        3)  {b['a3'] or ' '} | {b['b3'] or ' '} | {b['c3'] or ' '}
    """)
    ```

    The `print` statement above should produce something like the following in your terminal:

    ```bash
            A   B   C
        1)    |   |
            ----------
        2)    |   |
            ----------
        3)    |   |
    ```

2. **Rendering messages**

    The `print_message` method updates users about the current status of a game, including whose turn it is, who won the game, and if the game ended in a tie.

    ```py
    def print_message(self):
        ## If there is a tie: print("Tie game!")
        ## If there is a winner: print(f"{self.winner} wins the game!")
        ## Otherwise: print(f"It's player {self.turn}'s turn!")
    ```

3. **Consolidated rendering**
    Optionally, a third `render` method can be used to consolidate the other two, streamlining the rendering process:

    ```py
    def render(self):
        # Call upon print_board
        ## Call upon print_message
    ```

### Step 4 - Handling player input
Next, youâ€™ll need a method to handle user input, such as `get_move` or `place_piece`. This method should prompt a user to enter the key of an empty space on the `board`.

To capture player input, use the `input()` function. This function displays a prompt in the terminal and returns the string that the user enters.

```py
move = input(f"Enter a valid movie (example: A1): ").lower()
```

Within this method, itâ€™s essential to **ensure that the input received is valid**.

Valid input must satisfy two conditions:

1. The input corresponds to a key on the `board`.
2. The specified `board` space is currently unoccupied (`None`).

To achieve this, set up a loop that **continuously prompts the user until a valid input is received**. You can create an infinite loop with `while True`. When valid input is received, the loop should be configured to conclude with a `return` or `break` statement.

Take a look at the structure below for reference:

```py
  while True:
    # prompt user for input
    # If the input is valid, update the board and break the loop
    # otherwise, print a message notifying the user of the invalid input and allow the loop to continue
```

### Step 5 - Checking for a winner
Next, create a method for determining a winner by checking the `board` for the **eight** possible winning combinations. Upon detecting a winning combination, update the `winner` attribute to reflect the current player (`turn`).

A loop of some sort would be appropriate, but you can also check each combination manually:

```py
self.board['a1'] and (self.board['a1'] == self.board['b1'] == self.board['c1'])
```
> ðŸ’¡ This example checks for a winning condition across the top row. Similar logic can be applied to other win conditions.

### Step 6 - Checking for a tie
The `check_for_winner` method should be followed with a `check_for_tie` method.

This method should check if both of the following conditions are true:

1. The `board` is entirely filled in: All spaces on the `board` are filled, with no positions marked as `None`.
2. No `winner`: A `winner` has not already been declared.

If both of these conditions are met, the value of `tie` should be set to `True`.

### Step 7 - Switching turns
The `switch_turn` method should alternate the value of `turn` between `'X'` and `'O'`. This should occur at the end of every turn. There are several ways to accomplish this, but a small lookup table using a dictionary might work nicely.

## Step 8 - Managing gameplay
The last step is combining all these methods in a functional gameplay loop. The loop should continue until a `winner` or `tie` is declared.

Below is an outline of how you might structure the `play_game` method:

```py
  def play_game(self):
    print("Shall we play a game?")
    # While there is no winner or tie
        # render
        # get player input
        # check for a winner
        # check for a tie
        # switch turns
        # ...repeat until there is a winner or tie
    # Outside the loop, render state at the end of a game
```

## Additional Suggested Features
If you wish to expand on the functionality of your game, try implementing the following user stories:

- AAU, at the end of a game, I should be asked if I would like to play again.
- AAU, if I accept the offer to play again, the game should reset and begin again.
- AAU, if I decline the offer to play again, the program should stop running.
- AAU, I would like the game to record wins and losses and display these records at the end of every game.
